# Online Communication System Calculator

This repository contains an online calculator for various communication system parameters. The calculators are built using React and allow users to input system parameters to compute the required values.

## Features

1. **Sampler, Quantizer, Source Encoder, Channel Encoder, and Interleaver**:
    - Computes the number of bits and rate for each component.

2. **Resource Elements, OFDM Symbol, Resource Blocks, and Maximum Transmission using Parallel Resource Blocks**:
    - Calculates the number of bits and rate for each element.

3. **Power Transmission in a Flat Environment**:
    - Determines the power transmitted based on transmitter and receiver specifications.

4. **Throughput in Percent of Multiple Access Techniques**:
    - Computes the throughput for different multiple access techniques.

5. **Cellular System Design**:
    - Assists in designing a cellular system based on user inputs.
